# Week Two Homework - Portfoliio Initiation

## Getting Started

This project involved creating a personal portfolio. Since this was only week two I had ONE example to give for dev work history. I began the github/vscode connection establishment, once completed I moved onto editing my files. I started out with the basic HTML tags. From there assessed which direction I wanted to go to match the example portfolio given. Decided flexboxes were the best option. Created a CSS Stylesheet, then began to go back and forth until I got my basic look down.

I had to often refer to chatgpt, mdn, google, and scheduled a tutoring session. The following webpages really helped me understand flex boxes and placement of elements. Plus, it really drilled in the different between inline and block elements.

## User Story

I WANT to create professional looking portfolio displaying my dev experience
SO THAT my future employers can view my capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Issues Created / Solutions

  1. Add original source code to index.html
  2. Add stylesheets to help with your layout style
  3. Create README.md
  4. Test Links on webpage to verify they are linking to the correct areas of your page.
  5. Go through html and css files to check for redundancies or places where you can condense elements.
  6. Deployment.
